# World edit scarpet
 World edit with scarpet.
 
I know that another person did this (SnaveSutit), but they aren't updating it, and plus I wanted to do it with the new functionalities added recently to scarpet.

Gnembon's scarpet repo: https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet

The licence is the same as gnembon's repo for obvious reasons

Please don't sue me.
