# Code of Conduct

## Contributors

Please make sensible pr's, and if you want to make a pr about an issue you discovered, please open the issue and close it with your pr, so I can see what the issue was.

## Community

If you wanna make an issue, please use the templates, cos they make it easier to sort stuff out.
I know my two issues aren't like that, but they are milestones, which I decide.
